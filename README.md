# PasswordStrengthMeter
Receives a password and username, and determines whether the password is strong based on some criteria.
The program repeatedly asks you for a username and password until you enter a valid combination of both.
The Criteria is as follows:
1. Password must be of length 8 or more
2. The username must not be in the password
3. There must be a string of letters (4 or more consecutively).
4. There must be atleast one capital and one lower case letter.
5. There must atleast be one number in the password
6. No special characters are allowed

The second part of my code is a password Generator that creates a randomized password for the User.
This password contains the same criteria as the strength meter, except that it also limits the password to a length of 15.
